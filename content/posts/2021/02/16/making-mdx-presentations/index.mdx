Ever since I first saw Sara Viera's slides form Vue London 2018 I've
really liked the idea of writing a presentation in MDX.

Sara used something called MDX Deck and it's pretty dope! You write
your slides in Markdown and sprinkle in other nice bits around what
you're saying in the slide, you know like most presentations. I made a
couple of presentations using MDX Deck.

In it's simplest form this is what a presentation can look like in
Markdown using MDX, the `---` indicates the separator for the slides.

```markdown
# slide 1

This is the first slide

---

## Slide 2

This is the second slide
```

I've tried several other solutions along the way, here they are
listed:

- MDX Deck
- Gatsby Theme MDX Deck
- Next MDX Deck
- [Fusuma]
- [MDXP]
- Untested by me but I did find [MDX Vue Deck]

The first two are the same really with using Gatsby shadowing (theme)
for MDX Deck in Gatsby Theme MDX Deck.

For a _really_ good example of using MDX Deck as a theme inside of a
Gatsby project check out [Sam Larsen-Disney]'s site [sld.codes] and
the [presentations] pages inside there. Each presentation is it's own
MDX Deck slide deck. 🤯

MDX Deck is the OG of these and was a bit rough around the edges to
begin with, it's now at v4. I personally never had any joy using
anything above that when it came to using images in your
presentations, which my presentations relied on _a lot_.

I used MDX Deck happily for a couple of presentations but it always
irked me that certain support was missing causing a lot of people to
wonder if it was [still supported].

We get it, Jackson's a busy guy and OSS is, well OSS. So after I was
lined up to do talk about [Spreading the jamstack] at [Scale By the
Bay] I opted for something a touch more reliable to use, this is when
I discovered Next MDX Deck when [Monica Powell's slides] did a talk at
[MDX conf].

Next MDX Deck had the `MDXProvider` exposed which means that I could
fold in components at a high level rather than on the slide level.

This means that if
