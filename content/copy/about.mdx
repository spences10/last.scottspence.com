I'm a web developer for Creative Products at [Karmarama], based in
Farringdon, London UK.

I'm a second career dev, that reskilled from a VBA analyst developer
role into web development.

I have (as of <DateUpdated date={`2020-06-07`}/>) a 1,259 day GitHub
streak, there are several OSS projects I like to contribute to the
majority of my commits are for my projects, feel free to take a look
👀

I'm a massive fan of the [Jamstack] and in particular the progressive
web app generator [Gatsby]. Right now I'm enjoying integrating that
with as many things as possible, here are some examples:

- [This site]
- [My CV]
- [Cheat Sheets]

More details in the [portfolio section].

### Sectors I have worked in:

Finance (Risk, Asset Management), Property, Oil & Gas, Lloyd's
insurance market. As a web developer I've worked in government digital
transformation and now creative digital.

### My personality

I find it hard to identify my traits, so instead I took the
[16Personalities] test, here are [my results].

## My interests

I try to get to the gym three times a week to weight lift, that took
up quite a bit of my time over the last 3 years or so. I have focused
on the compound lifts bench, press, squat and my favourite,
[deadlift]!
