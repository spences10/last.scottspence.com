All the equipment and tools I use on a daily basis.

For home, I use Ubuntu 20.04 in place of Windows now. Windows is still
a good platform for web development and if you are a Windows user you
can see how to use Windows Subsystem Linux for web development in
[this guide], I also made a video for setting up [Ubuntu for web
development].

### At home: Desk

- My computer is a [Ryzen 5 Mini ITX build], my [first time PC
  building a PC].
- Desk chair is a [HÅG Capisco Puls]
- I run two [HP EliteDisplay's E232 58,4 cm (23")] Monitors through a
  Dell 452-BBOO USB 3.0 Ultra HD Triple Video Docking Station.
- Keyboard is now a [Logitech G815], I [made some notes] on it as
  well.
- Microphone, a [Fifine Usb Cardioid Studio Condenser Microphone]
  which is surprisingly good quality for the price.

### Editor + Terminal

- Microsoft [Visual Studio Code] with [Sarah Drasner]'s awesome [Night
  Owl] 🦉 theme
- Terminal of choice is [Tilix].
- [Victor Mono] font for both text editor and terminal.

### Desktop Apps

- I use OBS ([Open Broadcaster Software]) for recording some coding
  sessions.
- For light video editing I use [OpenShot Video Editor]

### At work: Desk

- My work computer is a i9 [MackBook Pro (15-inch, 2019)]

### Editor + Terminal

- Microsoft [Visual Studio Code] with [Sarah Drasner]'s awesome [Night
  Owl] 🦉 theme
- Hyper with Fish and Oh My Fish

### Desktop apps
